	<!-- 
		ENTITY CLASS: EntityAnimalCatchable 
			
		Giving an entityclass this class type will allow you to pick up the entity by 'killing' it.
		The class extends from AnimalRabbit by default so it's best to make sure you use it only on small game.
		
		PROPERTIES FOR THIS CLASS
		REQUIRED:
			<property name="Class" value="EntityAnimalCatchable, Mods" />
				This will make the entity catchable when you would usually kill it.
			<property name="ItemToReturn" value="{your_item}" />
				This tells the game what item to put in your inventory when the entity is picked up.
		
		OPTIONAL:
			<property name="HoldingItem" value="{your_item}" />
				Your character must be holding the following item to make sure that the entity gets picked up.
				Defaults to meleeHandPlayer if none is specified.
